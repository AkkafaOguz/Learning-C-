        //Static Modifier
        // With static keyword you make the class member accessible with Class name itself, without need to create an object to access to the member.
        // The main purpose behind it that, if it's a general method or field to use it does not have to use memory for every object. Like 'Console.WriteLine()'

        //Structs
        // It's like class. %99 percent class will be used. It's just light-weight objects like RgbColour

        //Arrays
        // A data structure to store a collection of variables of the same type.
        // int[] numbers = new [3];
        // var numbers = new int[3];

        //String
        // A sequence of characters
        // Strings are immutable. Once you create them you can not change them
        // Sting Literals -> string firstName = "Mosh"; 
        // String Concatenation -> string name = firstName + " " + lastName;
        // String Format -> string name = string.Format("{0} {1}", firstName, lastName);
        // String Join -> var numbers = new int[3] {1,2,3} -> string list = string.Join(",", numbers);

        //Enums
        // A set of name/value pairs (constants)
        // When you have related constants

        //Reference Types & Value Types
        // Look at pictures.
